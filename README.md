First finished project
Self-taught web developer, at this point I have only been coding for about 7 months and thats with a few breaks in that time also. I started with HTML5 and CSS3 and have added some basic knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery. I code almost everyday in order to continue to push myself and this is just to put my code out there for any critiques and suggesstions of more efficient ways to accomplish certain features.
